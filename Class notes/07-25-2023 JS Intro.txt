Computer:
A computer is an electronic machine that is used to input, process, and then output data, typically in binary form,
 according to instructions given to it in a variable program.
Computer is consist of Software and hardware.
    Software: Operating Systems, Microsoft Office Suite, Paint
    Hardware: Mouse, screen, printer, hard-disk, CPU

 Binary Code: ones and zeros
 1=one
 0=OFF

Programming language:
-You can create apps
-communication with the machine
-has rules (SYNTAX)
-Examples: JavaScript, Java, Go, Python, JavaScript



Interpeted lanaguages: Javascript
compiled lanaguages: lack ambiguity - confusion - conflict


Compilation - compile - compiler -> checking if your code is grammatically correct 
execut- excute 0 excutor  -> running the code


Install node.js and check the version
1. Download it from nodejs.org/en/Download
2.Mac: Open terminal and run "node - v"
 
 

 First program:
    console.log("Hello world!");    // This is a coding statement
        /* This is how you write 
        a multi line comment */


Note: It is recommended to put ; after every coding statement (JS) (unwritten rule)
In other lanaguages it is a must!


Console.log() is used to output the text
