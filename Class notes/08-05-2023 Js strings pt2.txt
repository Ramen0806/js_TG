ReCap:

String: it is one the data types (primitive-object)

let name1 = "John"; //primitive
let name2 = new String("John"); //object

name1 == name2 //true
name1 === name2 //false

name1 !== name2 //false
name1 !=== name2 //true

-Anything in double or single quotes known strings
-A sequence of characters (empty, one or more characters)
""," ", "1","Hello", "123", etc...


Template literals - string Templates
-backtickS (ES6)
-it allows us to embed some variables or expression in string
-it makes concatenation more professional and easier

let yearOfBirth = 1992;
let name = "John";

`${name} is  ${2023 - yearOfBirth} years old.` //John is 31 years old. //Interpolation
name + " is " (2023 - yearOfBirth) + " years old." //John is 31 years old. //concatenation

String functions: manipulates (update, modify, change, or more actions) the data stored in a string variable.

let word = "enjoy"; //JOY

length property: it gives us back how many characters you have in the string.

How to get first and last characters from a string?
let word1 ="Javascript", words = "Ruby";

word1[0]; //"J"
word2[0]; //"R"

word1[word1.length - 1] //"t"
word2[word2.length - 2] //"y"
                                                        ///////End of ReCap//////
