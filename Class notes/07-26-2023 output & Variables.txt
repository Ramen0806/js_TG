Recap:
Computer: Machine -> input, process, output
            Software + Hardware 
        
Binary Code: computer language that consists of of ones and zeros


Programming Languages: Javascript, Java, C, C++, Go, c#, etc...
Source Code: it is the code that is written with any programming language 
    Console.log("Hello world!"); //Coding statement 


Comments:
    // single line comment

    /* 
    A multi line comment 
    is written like this 
    */

How to duplict the code:
mac: option+ shift + down (or up)
windows: alt +shift+ down (or up)

Javascript vs other programming lanaguages:
Interpret: JavaScript: more flexible, less rules
Compiled: Java, c#, TypeScript -> more rules and lots of exceptions (~errors)

"Yuliia" (2, 4) -> li
"Yuiila" (4, 2) -> li 


Visual studio code: this is a code editor commonly used for JS
Intellij IDEA: This is mostly for java and Koltin

These code editors are known as IDE (Integrated development environment)






Escape Sequences: are special characters or combinations of characters that are used to represent certain characters 
that have special meaning or cannot be typed directly. Here are some commnonly used escape sequences in JavaScript:
\' Represents a single quote.
\" Represents a double quote.
\\ Represents a backslash.
\n Represents a new line.
\t Represents a tab.

Varoables - Declaration vs assignment vs initialization

JavaScript uses the keywords var, let and const for variables. 
(Interview Question: what is the difference between var, let, and const?)

When to use var?
var keyword is used in all JavaScript code from 1995 to 2015.
let and const keywords were added to JavaScript in 2015.
If you want your code to run in older browsers, you must use var.

When to use const?
const is used if you will not need to change your variable value.
const variables have final values which cannot be changed.

When to use let?
Variables defined with let cannot be updated-reassigned with a new value
let name; // declaration - reserve memory for the name 
name = "John"; //assignment

let age = 25; // initialization (storing data in variable)
= assignment operator


+ operator:
When used between strings = concatentation 
Example: "hello" + "abc" -> helloabc
        "123" + "12"  -> 12312

when used between numbers= addition 
 Example:
 12 + 2 -> 4

 when used between strings and numbers = concatentation
Example: "John" + 45 -> John45

when used between numbers and strings = concatentation
Example: 4 + "abc" -> 4abc
