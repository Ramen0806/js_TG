Primitive vs Object

Primitives: basic data types - allocates less memory - faster to use
Note : Primitives have a limited capacity to store data and that is why we use objects.

Objects: Complex data types - allocates more memory - slower to use

Property vs function
-function takes ()
-property takes no ()

Make sure you understand what property or the function you used returns and what is the return data type.
What it does? Task
what it returns? result-value
what is the return data type? result-data type


Function = Method = Behavior


Mutable = can be changed
Immutable = can not be changed

Strings are immutable data types


toLowerCase() : 
Task- converts all upper case to lower case
Return- string back lowercased
Data Type: String

toUpperCase() : 
Task- converts all lower case to upper case
Return- string back uppercased
Data Type: String

RAMEZ
R = 0
A = 1

Propert access with []
Task: returns the characters at the given index
Return: one character at the given index
Data type: string

Note: When you have a string with multiple characters:
The first character will always have index of 0
The last character will always have index of length-1
If you try to use an index that is out of the range 0 and the length -1, it returns undefined



"RAMEZ" - when you use charAt() anything after the last character will result in empty space

charAt() Function

If you try to use an index that is out of the range 0 and the length -1, it returns empty string

charCodeAt() Function

search() Function
Task: searches a string for another string (or a regular expression) and returns the position of the match.
